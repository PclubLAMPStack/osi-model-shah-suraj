7 layers of OSI model
The OSI model is a conceptual model that provides a common basis for the coordination of ISO standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection. The communications between a computing system are split into seven different abstraction layers :Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application. Each layer has its own protocols and services. Here are some of the protocols and services that are relevant to each layer:
# 7 layers of OSI model

The **OSI model** is a conceptual model that provides a common basis for the coordination of ISO standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection. The communications between a computing system are split into seven different abstraction layers :**Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.** Each layer has its own protocols and services. Here are some of the protocols and services that are relevant to each layer:

## 1. protocols

### Physical layer:
     Bit transmission and reception

### Data Link layer: 
     Framing, error detection and correction, flow control

### Network layer: 
     Logical addressing, routing, congestion control

### Transport layer:
     End-to-end connection establishment and termination, flow control, error recovery

### Session layer:
     Dialog control (keeping track of which side is talking), synchronization

### Presentation layer:
     Data representation and encryption/decryption

### Application layer: 
      Network process to application process communication



## 2. services

 ### Physical layer : 
      Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 

### Data Link layer :
     ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol), HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control)

### Network layer :
      IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)
### Transport layer : 
      TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol), SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)

### Session layer :   
      NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System), RPC (Remote Procedure Call)

### Presentation layer : 
      MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), TLS (Transport Layer Security)

### Application layer :
      HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
